You can of course simply use Yubnub like any other website. Just go to yubnub.org and type in a command.
But the adventurous will want to try alternative ways to use Yubnub.<br />

                    <li>In the "Alias:" box, type the letter that you would like to use to direct Maxthon to search with Yubnub.  For example, entering "y" would mean that typing in the address bar "y gim porsche" would cause Maxthon to use Yubnub to search Google Images for "porsche."**</li>
                    <li>In the "Engine:" box, paste in the copied address.</li>

                speed, enter "*" as the alias, which will make Maxthon use

                example, typing "gim porsche" after using "*" for the alias
                would make Maxthon search Google Images for "porsche." However,
                Maxthon already uses the alias "*" with a search engine, so to
                use this feature, you must remove that alias. To do this, follow
                steps 2 through 10, omitting step 3 and deleting the "*" in the

<b>To the adventurous:</b> Add Yubnub to your Firefox address bar by typing about:config in
the Location Bar then scrolling down the list and changing
keyword.URL to <i>http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=</i> <span style="padding-left:6px">You</span> haven't lived until you've turned the address bar into a
full-fledged command line. <i>(Thanks to Chuck Eglinton for helping me to word this more clearly)</i>
<b>Update:</b> Hmm ... After a while, the Firefox address bar doesn't seem to recognize one-word
Yubnub commands. I recommend instead the Firefox search plugin, described above. For keyword.URL I suggest
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_:_Tips_:_Location_Bar_Search">Google Browse-By-Name</a>. This does a Google search most of the time, but for especially common searches it takes you directly
to the first search result. Works very well in practice.<br />
<br />
<b>Yubnub Calculator.</b> John Gilman cleverly pointed out that you can type in 3*5 and Yubnub will give you 15.
This is because Yubnub defaults to Google, and thus uses Google Calculator.<br />

<b>Google Deskbar integration.</b> I was delighted with this tip from <a href="http://www.sternsquirt.com/">Michael Brindamour</a>:
"It should be noted that the Google Deskbar can be modified to use this as well, by adding it as a customized search with a shortcut (I used ctrl-y)." <br />

<b>Quicksilver integration.</b> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/2584878">Herr Theoretiker</a> has posted
<a href="http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/2005/06/yubnub-my-entry-for-rails-day-24-hour.html#c111929414922717729">instructions</a> for integrating Yubnub with Quicksilver, the
beloved Mac OSX program launcher. <b>Update:</b> Herr Theoretiker sends this update: "I found a way to make it even easier: I've added a QS trigger to the "Yubnub Search"
bookmark, so it's now just a single keypress and a command-line entry to access Yubnub." <b>Update:</b> Herr Theoretiker
says: "I found out this morning that the newest versions of Quicksilver do not come with the Web Search plug-in (required
for my QS-to-Yubnub hack) pre-installed . . . the plug-in is required . . . it is installed by
default in the Panther-compatible versions of QS."<br />
<br />
<b>Linux integration.</b> <a href="http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=g+bsittler">Benjamin Sittler</a> has written
a <a href="http://yubnub.org/yubnub.sh">bash script</a> to invoke Yubnub from the Linux command line. Benjamin
<a href="http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/2005/06/yubnub-my-entry-for-rails-day-24-hour.html#c111932733668772089">adds</a>:
"save it, change it's permissions to make it executable, and (optionally) set the BROWSER environment variable to
point to the web browser of your choice (i use w3m because it's pipe-friendly) and install it in a directory
on your PATH. works for linux, at least -- probably cygwin too." Yubnub, meet Tux.<br />
<br />
<b>Surfraw integration.</b> I've been hearing a lot about <a href="http://surfraw.sourceforge.net/">Surfraw</a>,
which is a Unix tool for accessing various web services (like a Yubnub for the Unix command line). Iain Broadfoot
has bridged the two worlds by writing a <a href="/yubnub-surfraw.txt">Yubnub plugin for Surfraw</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Safe Firefox Installation.</b> The safest way to install Yubnub is to make a Firefox keyword for it. If you're using the Firefox web browser:
<ul>
<li>Right-click the input box at the top of the page (the one under the words "Type in a command")</li>
<li>Click "Add a Keyword for this Search"</li>
<li>For the Name, enter "Yubnub", and for the Keyword, enter "y"</li>
<li>Press OK</li>
</ul>
Now you can use Yubnub directly from the address bar. For example, try typing "y gim porsche 911" into your address bar.
Don't forget the "y" in front!<br />
<div style="background: #eee; padding: 10px; margin: 10px">
You may have noticed that I said that this is the "safest way" to install Yubnub. Why safest? Because you must
explicitly enter a "y" before the Yubnub command. This prevents "command spoofing". <br />
<br />
For example, suppose someone made
a "michael" command. If you typed "michael jordan" into Yubnub, intending to do a search, you would instead
go to the site of the person who made the "michael" command. Rats! But if you installed Yubnub into your Firefox address
bar as described above, typing "michael jordan" into your address bar would do a search for "michael jordan", as you
intended. The only way to get to that other person's site would be to type "y michael".<br />
<br />
If you like to live on the edge like me, you can try one of the other installation methods, many of which do
not require an initial keyword like "y".
</div>
<b>SlickRun integration.</b> <a href="http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/">SlickRun</a> is another Yubnub-like utility whose fans
(zealots?) I've been hearing from. It's a free Windows program. xybre sent me an email about how to add Yubnub to SlickRun:
"Slickrun is a perfect component for using Yubnub, simply define a
keyword for use with Slickrun (in my case I used a foreward slash for
ease of use, like IRC), and then use the command
"http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=$w$" and it can be used to
launch YN commands with extreme ease. Check it out. :D"<br />
<br />
<b>GNOME integration.</b> Nigel Tao wrote me: "FYI, my 'Deskbar Applet' for GNOME easily turns into a Yubnub Deskbar,
kind of like Google's Deskbar. <a href="http://browserbookapp.sourceforge.net/deskbar.html">Screenshots</a>.
<a href="http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=780">Homepage</a>.
<a href="http://browserbookapp.sourceforge.net/deskbar-screencast.html">Video</a>.
Caveat: current version requires an
unstable version of gnome-python."<br />
<br />
<b>Replacing the address bar completely.</b> I was in awe when I read this profound idea sent to me by Michele Trimarchi:
"i'm thinking about replace url bar of my firefox with yubnub searchbar.. why don't u simply forward to the site when
someone don't insert a command but just a url?" Consider it done, Michele. Now you can enter a web address into Yubnub
(like "nba.com") and that's where you will go. <br />
<br />
So now you can use Yubnub in four ways.
You can type in a url like <span class="muted">porsche.com</span> and Yubnub will go there. You can type in a Yubnub command, like <span class="muted">gim porsche</span>
which will do an image search for "porsche". You can type in some search terms, like <span class="muted">cars</span>, to do a Google search for
"cars". And finally you can type in some well-known search terms, like <span class="muted">porsche</span>, and Google will take you straight to
porsche.com (this is because Yubnub defaults to Google's smart Browse-By-Name, not just plain Google).<br />
<br />
In effect, you can throw away your address bar and simply use your search bar. Below is a screenshot of Michele's idea --
simply remove the address bar and rely solely on the search bar:
<div class="blockquote">
  <img src="/images/firefox_without_address_bar.png">
</div>
I'm going to try this for a little bit to see how it goes. The only thing is that the search bar is a bit small (at least
on Firefox). Plus you don't
get to see the current URL. Would someone be willing to write a Yubnub Toolbar to overcome these limitations?<br />
<br />
(Incidentally the regex that Yubnub uses to recognize URLs is
<pre>    ^[^ ]+\.[a-z]{2,4}(/[^ ]*)?$</pre>
If anyone sees any flaws in this, <a href="mailto:jon@yubnub.org">let me know</a>)<br />
<br />
<b>Dave's Quick Search Deskbar.</b> Ryan Carpenter emailed me instructions for integrating Yubnub with <a
href="http://www.dqsd.net/">Dave's Quick Search Deskbar</a>
(DQSD). DQSD is a Windows deskbar that launches searches. A lot of
people (fanatics?) really like it. Ryan writes: "To use Yubnub.org on
Dave's Quick Search Deskbar, first follow the installation instructions
on dqsd.net, then add the <a href="/yubnub-dqsd.xml">attached xml file</a> to the localsearches
directory.  Then, reload DQSD by using its configure menu, or by
typing an exclaimation point and Enter. You can use the Yubnub search engine at any time by preceding your
search with yn.  You can get some help on the Yubnub/DQSD search by
typing yn? And Enter." Thanks Ryan!<br />

<b>SmartPhone/PocketPC integration.</b> If you have a SmartPhone or PocketPC and surf the web with
<a href="http://www.southwaycorp.net/multiie.htm">MultiIE</a>, you can turn your address bar
into a Yubnub command line:
<div class="blockquote">
  <a href="http://www.southwaycorp.net/multiie.htm"><img src="/images/yubnub_multiie.png"></a>
  <a href="http://www.southwaycorp.net/multiie.htm"><img src="/images/yubnub_multiie_options.png" style="padding-left:20px"></a>
</div>
Just go to MultiIE Options > Misc > Address Bar Macros > Open Button Custom 1, then type in the following:
http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=#^;-Yubnub (as shown in the picture on the right). You will then be
able to enter a Yubnub command (like "gim porsche 911") then click Yubnub (as shown on the left).<br />

on how to add Yubnub to your Blackberry mobile device: <i>I did something similar with
<a href="http://www.thebogles.com/Berry411.htm">Berry411</a> (an awesome search client

to Berry411, so you can now type "yn: gim porsche" into your Blackberry. For more information, see
<a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/07/yubnub-goes-mobile.html">Phillip's post</a>. Here's a nice pic

He calls it <a href="http://yubutils.sourceforge.net/">yubutils</a>, and it has three parts: a GUI for Yubnub, a
command-line interface, and a Python library:

<b>Opera integration 2.</b> Chaitanya Krishna sent me these alternative
instructions for adding Yubnub to Opera on Linux. The steps
are probably similar for Windows:
<div class="blockquote">
1. cd ~/.opera<br />
2. make a backup of the file search.ini:<br />
<div class="blockquote">
   cp search.ini search.ini.bk
</div>
3. open search.ini in a text editor<br />
4. append these lines to the file<br />
<div class="blockquote">
[Search Engine 38]<br />
Name=Yubnub<br />
URL=http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=%s<br />
Query=<br />
Key=y<br />

Has endseparator=0<br />
Encoding=utf-8<br />
Search Type=0<br />
Verbtext=17063<br />

</div>
5. Replace 38 with the next number in the search.ini file. Mine had 37 previously.<br />
6. Restart Opera.<br />
7. Typr y gim porsche 911 in the address bar and watch the magic.
</div>
<b>Update:</b> xybre reports success installing Yubnub in Opera for Windows:
<i>"I saw the Linux howto for Opera, I did it on Windows with a handy
program called <a href="http://starzaki.eu.org/~hclan/operapl/en/download.html">Opsed</a>.
It's wizard interface so it's easy to use. It also autodetects the location of the
files, allows you to change the order and everything. And now I have
Yubnub set as my default search in Opera too.. like with everything
else. Hope this helps."</i> <b>Update:</b> xybre says:
<i>"I forgot to mention, that if you have Yubnub first in the list (either
with Opsed, or manually or otherwise) it will default to it when you
type in text to the address bar that isn't a URL. You can also set up
a keyword like in Firefox to be "y" for example."</i><br />
<br />
<b>Safari integration with the Sogudi extension.</b> <a href="http://hochmann.org">Thomas Hochmann</a> sent me these
instructions:
<div class="blockquote">
The tip for integrating Yubnub into the Safari search box is usable,
but I prefer using the free 'Sogudi' extension for Safari. Here are
some rough directions for how to use it - I figured I'd pass this on
for others who want to use Yubnub in the address bar without having to
resort to the pagan Firefox for OS X. :)<br />
<br />
Sogudi allows you to add keyword shortcuts and searches that can be
typed into the address bar. But even better than this is its ability
to redirect to a default shortcut if you type something with more than
one word. It defaults to Google, but it can be easily configured to
direct commands to Yubnub:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li> <a href="http://www.atamadison.com/w/kitzkikz.php?page=Sogudi">Download Sogudi</a> and install it.
<li> Start Safari.
<li> Click the Safari menu and select "Sogudi".
<li> If there is a shortcut called "default", change its destination URL to: http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=@@@
<li> If there isn't a shortcut called "default", simply create it, using the destination URL from #4.
</ol>
<br />
Now whenever you type a multi-word entry in the address bar (such as
"img tomiko van") it will go through Yubnub. The only drawback is that
this method does not work at all for single-word Yubnub commands. As a
workaround, I just created another Sogudi command called "y" so I can
type "y nmts" to execute the "nmts" command.
</div>
Thanks, Thomas! <b><i>Update:</i></b> Robert Brook gives this tip: <i>
I've found that I can use the default Sogudi trigger with single words by just adding a space at the beginning.
For example: "img rails tutorial" bounces to http://images.google.com/images?q=rails+tutorial
And " ls" (note leading space!) bounces to http://yubnub.org/kernel/ls?args=</i><br />

<b>Yubnub search bar (browser-independent).</b> Inspired by Felipe
Gomes' <a href="http://projects.felipc.com/gcl/">Google Command
Line</a>, Sean O'Hagan has written a neat <a
href="http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=man+cmdline">Yubnub
search-bar</a> that lives at the bottom of your browser. The neat
thing about it is that it works in almost any browser, because it uses
a simple HTML frame. To start it up, simply type <a
href="http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=cmdline">cmdline</a> into
Yubnub. Then try typing "gim porsche" into the command-line at the
bottom of the screen (or a URL like google.com). <b>Update:</b>
Felipe Gomes has added Yubnub to the original
<a href="http://projects.felipc.com/gcl/">Google Command Line</a>.
So now you can type "/yubnub gim porsche" into it.<br />
<br />
<b>PSP integration.</b> Brenden Mecleary has created a <a href="http://dia.phano.us/">
Yubnub page
optimized for PlayStation Portables</a>. Brenden writes: "Yubnub seemed a
good choice because (a) I think it's a really killer idea and
(b) text entry on the PSP is a nightmare, so anything to save a
few keystrokes is welcome, and YN seems well-suited to that.".<br />
<br />
<b>LaunchBar integration (Mac OSX)</b>. <a href="http://hochmann.org">Thomas Hochmann</a> writes:
<div class="blockquote">
<a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/">LaunchBar</a> is an
amazing little Mac OS X utility that lets you pull up documents,
applications, Sherlock channels, iTunes playlists, web searches,
etc. with a couple keystrokes. You can have it index any area of your
hard drive you want, and add web search templates for Google,
etc. It's basically like Spotlight but without the overhead, and with
more web-oriented features.<br />
<br />
Here's how to add a Yubnub command line to LaunchBar:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li> Summon LaunchBar using your favorite key combo.
<li> Hit CMD-Y to bring up the Configuration window.
<li> Click on "Search Templates" in the left pane. I use UTF-8 templates for all my LaunchBar shortcuts, but use whichever one you prefer.
<li> Click the "Add" button.
<li> Type "Yubnub" for the name, and enter the following for the URL: http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=*
<li> Close the window and save your changes when prompted.
</ol>
<br />
Now you can bring up LaunchBar and type something like "yn" or "yub"
and then hit space. Then you can type your Yubnub command. So for
myself, the process would go something like... CTRL-Space to bring up
LaunchBar, type "yub" and hit space, and type in "wp
fishsticks". <br />
<br />

<b>K-Meleon integration.</b> Liam Kirsh provided these instructions: <i>"You have to go to Tools &gt; Web Search &gt; Configure and add Yubnub to Web Search. Then close the window, and go to Tools &gt; Web Search &gt; Configure &gt; Keyword autosearch and select Yubnub."</i><br />
<br />
<b>Yahoo! Toolbar integration.</b> Shantanu Oak sent me this tip:
<i>"If you have the latest Yahoo Toolbar installed, you can use yahoo
shortcuts from IE: Tools - Yahoo! services - Yahoo! Shortcuts.
Click on Add... and type the name to the shortcut for e.g. quick.
Now add the URL... http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=%s
Now, if you want the pictures of flowers simply type...
quick gim flowers"</i>. <b>Update:</b> Shantanu adds:
<i>"One should also note that you can create Address bar on the taskbar.
Right click anywhere on the taksbar and choose Toolbars - Address.
Typing the command is easier now since the address bar is always
visible on the taskbar even if you are working on something else like
word or excel.
If the focus is on the start button, hitting the tab key will activate
the address bar and you can start typing the command."</i><br/>

<b>Yubnub bookmarklet.</b> Brian Armknecht has written a
<a href='javascript:q = "" + (window.getSelection ? window.getSelection() : document.getSelection ? document.getSelection() : document.selection.createRange().text); p = prompt("Yubnub search type? ... ", ""); if (q!=null) location="http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=" + escape(p).replace(/ /g, "+") + " " + escape(q).replace(/ /g, "+"); void 0'>bookmarklet for Yubnub</a>
(works on Firefox; doesn't seem to work on IE). Brian writes:
<i>"There are occasions where I'd like to perform a Yubnub command on some text
on a webpage (e.g. a word I'd like to define, or an address I'd like to map).
I created a new Yubnub bookmarklet for this.  First highlight the text, then
click the bookmarklet.  A dialogue box pops up to ask the Yubnub command to be
used.  It then performs that command on the highlighted text."</i>. Thanks Brian!

<b>MSN integration</b>. superJC has added Yubnub to an MSN bot called Virtual Secretary:
<i>"I've discovered Yubnub this week-end and found it so
great that I decided to integrate a command in my MSN

contacts to use it).
This bot can manage your favorites, agenda, contacts,
notes... you can chat with it, it can send emails...
and now it can execute Yubnub commands: just by typing
"yub" or "y" followed by the Yubnub command. I display
the URL and also the web page in the messenger
activity window."</i>
